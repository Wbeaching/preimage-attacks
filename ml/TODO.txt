- Runtime / speed... calculate loss faster with matrix operations?

- Find out where NeuroSAT has trouble, look at error per node on graphs (CNF and/or DAG)
    - Why can't solve on single problem with single observed set?
        XOR2 and XOR3 are hardest to predict
        Increasing T=10 --> T=20 no improvement
        Increasing d=128 --> d=512 much slower training, much more parameters, not significant improvement
        Turn off L2 penalty --> Almost identical to 1e-9 penalty
        Tune learing rate
        LR 1e-4 --> 1e-5 : nope
    
    Try with only XOR2 or XOR3... (small problem)
    Will it solve?
